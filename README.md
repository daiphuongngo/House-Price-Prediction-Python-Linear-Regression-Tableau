# Project: Housing Price Prediction in the Ames, Iowa, United States

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data 

Programming language: Python 

Platform: Spyder (Anaconda)

Statistics model: Linear Regression

# Overview: 

79 explanatory variables are provided from the dataset and describe aspects of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. This evaluation model will take 10 features (listed below) as the main influencers to be analyzed and visualized with Python and basic Linear Regression to assess the final Root Mean Squared Error of the US house prices in Ames. With further emphasis on the period of 2006-2010, when the Financial Crisis 2007-2008 happened, this model will discuss which variable becomes the most influential feature affecting the Sale Price in Ames.

10 key features for the analysis: 'SalePrice', 'MSSubClass', 'MSZoning', 'LotArea', 'BldgType', 'HouseStyle', 'YearBuilt', 'YrSold', 'SaleType', 'SaleCondition', â€˜OverallQual

# Modeling & Evaluation:

The model evaluated on Root Mean Square Error (rsme) receives a result at roughly $38,700 which shows that this error in predicting house prices is satisfactory. The variable having the most impact on Sale Price is Overall Quality which indicates the highest correlation index at 0.79 among all features.
Homebuyers in the US should take care of the Overall Quality of their property as their main feature to consider before selling and buying. What comes next is when to do it as before the Financial Crisis 2007-2008, house prices might be higher with more flexible sale types and conditions. 
As the Crisis began in 2007, a drop in prices could be a great loss for sellers but a once-in-a-lifetime deal for buyers if they afforded to purchase as previous bank loans became tightened until further actions aiding the US economy proceeded by the US President and US Congress.

# Project: Housing Price Prediction in the Ames, Iowa, United States

Category: Real Estate

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data 

Programming language: Python 

Platform: Spyder (Anaconda)

Statistics model: Linear Regression

## Modeling & Evaluation:

The model evaluated on Root Mean Square Error (rsme) receives a result at roughly $38,700 which shows that this error in predicting house prices is satisfactory. The variable having the most impact on Sale Price is Overall Quality which indicates the highest correlation index at 0.79 among all features.
Homebuyers in the US should take care of the Overall Quality of their property as their main feature to consider before selling and buying. What comes next is when to do it as before the Financial Crisis 2007-2008, house prices might be higher with more flexible sale types and conditions. 
As the Crisis began in 2007, a drop in prices could be a great loss for sellers but a once-in-a-lifetime deal for buyers if they afforded to purchase as previous bank loans became tightened until further actions aiding the US economy proceeded by the US President and US Congress.

### I. Overview	

79 explanatory variables are provided from the dataset and describe aspects of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. This evaluation model will take 10 features (listed below) as the main influencers to be analyzed and visualized with Python and basic Linear Regression to assess the final Root Mean Squared Error of the US house prices in Ames. With further emphasis on the period of 2006-2010, when the Financial Crisis 2007-2008 happened, this model will discuss which variable becomes the most influential feature affecting the Sale Price in Ames.

10 key features for the analysis: 'SalePrice', 'MSSubClass', 'MSZoning', 'LotArea', 'BldgType', 'HouseStyle', 'YearBuilt', 'YrSold', 'SaleType', 'SaleCondition', â€˜OverallQual

Sale Prices mainly focus on a range from US$ 100,000 up to 200,000 through the 6-year period. So, this chart shows an initial glance of a price range with high spendings in the housing market.

#### 1/ MsSubClass: Identifies the type of dwelling involded in the sale	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621486-a027a010-ec84-4e12-a7b1-c2038448a186.png)

Generally, the identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale are assumed to have strong positive correlation with Sale Prices. However, Sale Prices are randomly distributed in all types of dwelling involved in the sale instead. For most, 1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES and 2-STORY 1946 & NEWER takes the most proportion of identities, mainly ranging from around US$20,000 to slightly over 400,000 per property for 1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES. While it takes a span from around US$120,0000 to 460,000 per property for 2-STORY 1946 & NEWER. This proves that homebuyers processes home deals with any kinds of properties, especially 1-story and 2-story houses. We can see that the weak negative correlation between MSSubClass vs SalePrice reaches only at -0.084. 

#### 2/ MSZoning: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale

As a whole, homebuyers aimed at a property rate starting from around US$100,000 per property in all zones except some areas such as Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial and Residential Low Density Park with q25 beginning from US$50,000. While their q75 is able to reach at nearly US$ 100,000. To be more specific, Floating Village Residential takes the greatest Sale Prices with q25 arring at nearly US175,000 and q75 extending up to US$250,000. Meanwhile, Residential Low Density takes the second place with q25 almost extending to US$150,000 and q75 getting as fas as approximately US$225,000. All in all, most house deals distribute at and above US$100,000 per property proves that house values are considered to be at high rates for a majority of homebuyers.

#### 3/ LotArea: Lot size in square feet	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621568-d92a43d8-483c-4b50-b166-c5bf7d12b526.png)

As we can see intuitively, a great number of house merchants takes place in properties below 50,000 square feet per property. These sizes cover up a range of prices largely below US$400,000. It is supposed that the larger the lot area, the greater the price. However, this is proved uncertain as the Lot Area has a small positive correlation with Sale Price at an index of 0.264. This means that Lot Area would not really affect the overall Sale Price even if the lot size could expand further. So, this also means that in the housing market, Lot Area can be bigger but it has a minor impact on any house values.

#### 4/ BldgType: Type of dwelling	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621620-796738f1-895a-4a43-babf-0bb937976521.png)

Another proof to confirm that Sale Prices all start from US$100,000 and above in all building types is the chart of Building Type vs Sale Price. It is highlighted that the Single-family Detached building takes the longest range of Sale Price with q25 above US$130,000 and q75 very close to US$ 225,000. Followingly, Townhouse Inside Unit and Townhouse End Unit come at the next places. These are the most common properties for single families with a decent lot area below 50,000 square feet. It can be seen that the more separated between a family and another for a house, the higher the price. So, homebuyers tend to buy more single units than a combined or shared property with other families. High mortgage approval rates led to a large pool of homebuyers, which drove up housing prices. This appreciation in value led large numbers of homeowners (subprime or not) to borrow against their homes as an apparent windfall. This "bubble" would be burst by a rising single-family residential mortgages delinquency rate beginning in August 2006 and peaking in the first quarter, 2010.

#### 5/ HouseStyle: Style of dwelling	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621645-0b9a5d63-1337-40f6-8e7a-5fdb09c41bc7.png)

This chart also illustrates that all house styles have a range of prices mostly starting from US$100,000 and above no matter what statuses of they are or how many stories they have. We can easily see that more stories in a single unit and / or finished status of the house can lead to higher prices for homebuyers. Specifically, 2-story house takes the longest range and it is also the most expensive style when its q25 begins above US$150,000 and q75 ends up nearly at US$ 250,000. Another thing to mention is that Two and one-half story: 2nd level finished and One story (finished) take high prices as well with their q75 in the mid US$210,000-230,000. In the meantime, unfinished houses such as the one and one-half story: 2nd level unfinished is the least preferred with both q275 and q75 below US$ 120,000.

#### 6/ YearBuilt: Original construction date	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621663-c1b9d2f9-5e56-4b30-8bef-a28d82858b01.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621665-d5ba9bc4-05e5-4f24-9193-a8c8382c377b.png)

According to the lm chart, it can be seen that there is a moderate positive correlation between Year Built and Sale Price from 1872 to 2010 at 0.523. Some highlights can be mentioned that there were several long-term downturns in newly built houses throughout The World War I (1914-1918), The Great Depression (1929-1933) and The World War 2 (1939-1945). In contrast, during the Economic Crisis (2007-2008), houses built in these years and in the previous preriod have a surge in Sale Price as demand rises up with more lax mortgages in the previous crisis. 

#### 7/ Yrsold: Year Sold	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621684-a59f7221-1d06-4833-8af6-6f4752fe34f5.png)

Logically, SalePrice would increase due to inflation annually. However, from 2006 to 2008, housing prices started to decrease, showing in q50, q75, q99 and range from q25 to q75 when comparing with 2007. The reason was that the 2007-2008 economic crisis had affected the housing market. There was also a slightly negative correlation between Year Sold and Sale Price at -0.029. This minor index was probably thanks to the Sale Price then started to recover at a slow velocity in 2009 and 2010 after United States President Barack Obama and US Congress's multiple regulatory and long-term responses. Therefore, there would be high prices generally for homebuyers to buy with newly revised mortgages.

Regulatory proposals and long-term responses Further information: Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009, Regulatory responses to the subprime crisis, and Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate United States President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009. The proposals address consumer protection, executive pay, bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives, and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions, among others. In January 2010, Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading. The proposals were dubbed "The Volcker Rule", in recognition of Paul Volcker, who has publicly argued for the proposed changes. The US Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, following the House, which passed a bill in December 2009. These bills must now be reconciled. The New York Times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the Obama administration. For instance, the Volcker Rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation, though in the Senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades. 

#### 8/ Sale Type

According to the boxplot chart, overall, all types of sales are over US$100,000 per property. This is at a high rate for the housing market. It seemed that homebuyers tended not to buy properties at a moderate rate but spend a large amount of banking loans thanks to mortgages on housing matters. Furthermore, they seemed to buy new ones at the highest range of prices. When looking at the swarm plot chart, Warranty Deed - Conventional's payment method took the greatest amount of housing sales and Home just constructed and sold took the second place. This is because there were too many homeowners with questionable credit and that banks had allowed people to take out loans for 100% or more of the value of their new homes.

### 9/ Sale Condition	

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621741-e4a100c0-d6ef-4001-9175-fe087faaefa0.png)

According to these 2 charts, housing sale cases mainly forms in groups of Normal Sale, Abnormal Sale -  trade, foreclosure, short sale and Partial	 Sale -Home was not completed when last assessed (associated with New Homes). Specifically, Normal Sales has the most cases ranging strongly from US$ 100,000 up to 300,000 while the range of the Partial Sales fluctuates shorter from US$ 150,000 to 250,000 and the one of Abnormal Sale spans the shortest from US$100,000 to 150,000. In general, these 3 conditions all started from around US$100,000 and above which illustrates house deals are completed at a high rate level. This also draws attention to an overview of different conditions for the majority of housing deals with normal and short processes.

The precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007â€“2008 was a high default rate in the United States subprime home mortgage sector, i.e. the bursting of the "subprime bubble". This happened when many housing mortgage debtors failed to make their regular payments, leading to a high rate of foreclosures. While the causes of the bubble are disputed, some or all of the following factors must have contributed. Also, low interest rates encouraged mortgage lending.

Regarding the Securitization, any mortgages were bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities, in a process known as securitization. These bundles could be sold as (ostensibly) low-risk securities partly because they were often backed by credit default swaps insurance. Because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages (and the associated risks) on in this way, they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria (due in part to outdated and lax regulation).
Mortgage guarantees. Many of the subprime (high risk) loans were bundled and sold, finally accruing to the quasi-government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The implicit guarantee by the US federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending.

#### 10/ OverallQual: Rates the overall house material and completion 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/138621779-8fba90a9-885b-4c7d-aa7a-008c302268d4.png)

The Overall Quality has a very strong correlation with Sale Price as its correlation index is roughly 0.79. It seems that they have a linear relationship. In general, the higher point a property could get, the better prices its value could reach. This trend was not changed even through the assessed period when the Financial Crisis 2007-2008 took place.

### III. Model & Evaluation	

The model evaluated on Root Mean Square Error (rsme) receives a result at roughly $38,700 which shows that this error in predicting house prices is satisfactory. The variable having the most impact on Sale Price is Year Sold which indicates the highest correlation index at 0.79 among all features. Home buyers in the US should take care of the Overall Quality of their property as their main feature to consider before selling and buying. What comes next is when to do it as before the Financial Crisis 2007-2008, house prices might be higher with more flexible sale types and conditions. In fact, as the Crisis began in 2007, a drop in prices could be a great loss for sellers but a once-in-a-lifetime deal for buyers if they afforded to purchase as previous bank loans became tightened until the US President Obama pushed the US Congress for further actions aiding the US economy.
